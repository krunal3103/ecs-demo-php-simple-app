# A simple PHP sample app
This is a sample repository without a Dockerfile that will be given to DockerRocker.

DockerRocker will then create a Dockerfile and upload to this repo.

It will keep tracking for any commits made on this repo thereafter and create an image on AWS.

Once the image is ready it will prompt the user and then deploy the image and provide the user with the link!!


Making some changes!!
